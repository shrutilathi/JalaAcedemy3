 *5.Create two interfaces with the same method (same signature) in both the interfaces. 
Implement these two interfaces in one class. Call the method
 * @author shruti
 * If a type implements two interfaces, and each interface define a method that has identical signature, 
 * then in effect there is only one method, and they are not distinguishable.
 * If, say, the two methods have conflicting return types, then it will be a compilation error.
